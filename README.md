# 🧩 Crossword Game - Android App

A crossword puzzle game for Android inspired by Netflix Puzzled, built in Kotlin. This is my very first attempt at creating an android app so it's very much a work in progress. 
The main structure is laid out but puzzles are not working properly. Experimental builds for now.

## 

## How to Build & Run

### Requirements
- Android Studio (Hedgehog or newer)
- Android SDK 34
- Kotlin 1.9+
- A physical Android device or emulator (API 24+)

### Steps
1. Open **Android Studio**
2. Choose **"Open an Existing Project"**
3. Navigate to the `CrosswordGame` folder and open it
4. Wait for Gradle to sync (this may take a minute)
5. Connect your Android device via USB (enable USB debugging in Developer Options)
   OR launch an emulator from the AVD Manager
6. Click the green **▶ Run** button

### Build APK (for sideloading)
1. In Android Studio: **Build → Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) → Build APK(s)**
2. The APK will be at: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
3. Transfer to your phone and install (enable "Install from unknown sources")
